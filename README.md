# Hello, World! üëãüèº

I am a software developer who is highly skilled at fixing the issues that I've made myself. Think of me as the Batman of debugging - I may have created the problem, but I'll be the one to save the day!

## About Me

- I love writing code in TypeScript and Python, but I'm always open to learning new things. It's like a never-ending adventure, except with fewer dragons and more curly braces.
- I'm OK with Angular, but I have to admit that my heart beats a little faster when I see some good old-fashioned JQUERY code. Don't judge me - we all have our guilty pleasures.
- I have a keen eye for detail, and I take pride in writing clean, efficient, and scalable code. Plus, I always make sure to leave enough comments for future me (or anyone else who has the misfortune of having to work with my code).
- I really like using long variable names that explain exactly what they hold. I find it helps me read my code faster without having to dive into the inner workings of each variable or function. Speaking of which...

## Functions that Tell a Story

I'm a firm believer that code should be readable like a storybook. That's why I love giving my functions names that tell a story. Think of it like the Game of Thrones of TypeScript.

Let me give you an example. Say I'm writing a function to calculate the average age of a group of people. Sure, I could call it something boring like `calculateAverageAge()`, but where's the excitement in that?

Instead, I'll name it something like `findTheAverageAgeOfAllTheInhabitantsOfWesteros()`. Suddenly, my function is more than just a block of code - it's a quest to discover the age of every single person in the Seven Kingdoms.

Or how about a function that sorts an array of numbers? That could be called `putTheseNumbersInOrderOrFaceTheWrathOfTheIronThrone()`. It's like we're deciding the fate of the realm with a single line of code.

And let's not forget about the function that checks if a number is even or odd. That's no ordinary function - that's a battle for the ages! We could call it `determineWhetherThisNumberBelongsToHouseStarkOrHouseLannister()`.

Okay, maybe that last one is a bit of a stretch, but you get the idea. By giving our functions names that tell a story, we're not only making our code more readable, but we're also injecting a bit of drama and excitement into our work.

So the next time you're tempted to name a function something boring like `processData()`, ask yourself - what kind of epic tale can I tell with this code? Who knows, you might just unleash your inner George R. R. Martin and create something truly unforgettable.

## Fun Facts

- I once spent an entire day debugging a program, only to realize that the issue was a typo in the file name. #facepalm
- I've been known to get into heated arguments with my code editor. I swear it has a mind of its own sometimes!
- I firmly believe that coffee is the lifeblood of software development. If you catch me without a cup in hand, please send help.
- I can do super complicated things in 20 minutes, but be stuck for 2 hours trying to remove items from a loop without understanding why it's not working. We all have our moments, right?

## Black Ops

Oh, and one more thing - at Rezonate, my title is "Black Ops." That means I get all the shiny stuff, but if anything I do gets exposed, I'm the one who takes the blame. It's a high-pressure job, but I thrive on the challenge.
