# Hello, World! üëãüèº

I am a software developer who is highly skilled at fixing the issues that I've made myself. Think of me as the Batman of debugging - I may have created the problem, but I'll be the one to save the day!

## About Me

- I love writing code in TypeScript and Python, but I'm always open to learning new things. It's like a never-ending adventure, except with fewer dragons and more curly braces.
- I'm OK with Angular, but I have to admit that my heart beats a little faster when I see some good old-fashioned JQUERY code. Don't judge me - we all have our guilty pleasures.
- I have a keen eye for detail, and I take pride in writing clean, efficient, and scalable code. Plus, I always make sure to leave enough comments for future me (or anyone else who has the misfortune of having to work with my code).

## Fun Facts

- I once spent an entire day debugging a program, only to realize that the issue was a typo in the file name. #facepalm
- I've been known to get into heated arguments with my code editor. I swear it has a mind of its own sometimes!
- I firmly believe that coffee is the lifeblood of software development. If you catch me without a cup in hand, please send help.

## Black Ops

Oh, and one more thing - at Rezonate, my title is "Black Ops." That means I get all the shiny stuff, but if anything I do gets exposed, I'm the one who takes the blame. It's a high-pressure job, but I thrive on the challenge.

## Get in Touch

If you have any questions, comments, or just want to geek out about code, feel free to reach out to me at benji@rezonate.io. I'm always happy to chat with fellow developers and exchange war stories. Let's create something amazing together!
